# pay-better

The motivation for this project is to provide a simple way for an employer to keep better track of employee payroll.
I built this project to aid business owners and managers. This project solves the problem of using multiple resources in tandem to keep track of employee names, salaries, and average pay.
I learned about data types, arrays, objects, methods, and functions. My project stands out because I have provided different answers to old questions.
